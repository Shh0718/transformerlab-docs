# Introduction

## What is Transformer Lab?

<!-- <img src={require('/img/flask.png').default} alt="Login Modal" width="80" /> -->

Transformer Lab is a free, open-source LLM workspace that you can run on your own computer. It is designed to go beyond what most modern open LLM applications allow. Using Transformer Lab you can easily finetune, evaluate, export and test LLMs across different inference engines and platforms.

Transformer Lab works well for users with access to a GPU or TPU (local or in the cloud). It also works well on M-series (M1, M2, M3) Apple Mac computers using <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a>.

Researchers and engineers can use Transformer Lab to execute experiments and track their results.

Users in the LLM ecosystem can build plugins for Transformer Lab to extend it's functionality in new ways.

Our plan is to continue to expand Transformer Lab to support numerous advanced applications of LLMs. We'd love your help! Start by joining our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/transformerlab"><FaDiscord/> Discord</a>.
