# 5. Edit Prompts

Transformer Lab allows you to edit the System prompt both from the **Prompts** tab and from the **Interact->Chat** pages.

<img src={require('../img/prompt.gif').default} alt="Model Zoo" width="700" />

Our plan with Transformer Lab is to allow you to do more than just modify the initial system prompt, including editing the general template that is sent to the model, editing chat templates, etc.
