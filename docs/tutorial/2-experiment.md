# 2. Start an Experiment

To start your journey in Transformer Lab, the first step is to create an **Experiment**.

An experiment is a container for work with an LLM. It will contain all the data needed to define the foundation model used, the training method and data used to finetune it, and any scripts used to modify it.

To create an experiment, click on the current experiement name under "Experiment" to select or create a new experiment.
